# Students' data analysis
This project performs general data analysis on a dataset of students. The dataset contains students' achievement in mathematics subject of two Portuguese secondary education schools. Data source: University of California, Irvine's dataset database:
[Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

## Content
There are three main files in this project:
* [math_student_analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/oserradilla/students-data-analysis/blob/master/math_student_analysis.Rmd): loads the dataset and performs all the analysis explained below. The output generated by this script has been saved into an html file with the same name.
* [math_student_analysis.html](https://github.com/oserradilla/students-data-analysis/blob/master/math_student_analysis.html): shows the results generated by executing the Rmd script. This file can be opened in any browser to see the results without having to execute the R script.
* [student-mat.csv](https://github.com/oserradilla/students-data-analysis/blob/master/student-mat.csv):  I do not own the dataset. It is located in the following url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance However, in order to facilitate the download and setup of the project, it has been added to the repository.

## Applied analysis techniques
The following techniques have been applyed to perform the analysis: 
* General descriptive analysis
* Dimensionality reduction methods
* Clustering
* Regression and general linear models
